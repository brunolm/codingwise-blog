I wanted to create a project using Angular2. I started to code it and I realized I would have to setup a few things.

I choose to use Webpack because it has some dev tools, auto-reload. It wasn't so simple to set it up, their documentation didn't help me much.

It was then that I decided I needed to make things simpler so I created [brunolm/angular2-startup](https://github.com/brunolm/angular2-startup). It is a project with just the essential, nothing else. Simple and clean.

You can see that in this project there is a `README.md` where I tried to write all the steps I went through to create that setup and the issues I faced.

I recently started using Workflowy (it is free), which is a website where you can create lists and it allows you to use as a brain dump. If you want to check it out you can use this link to get extra items [https://workflowy.com/invite/35df8d82.lnx](https://workflowy.com/invite/35df8d82.lnx)

And I also added [all the steps on my Workflowy](https://workflowy.com/s/HO3ACHwWFT) and instructions on [my Knowledge List](https://workflowy.com/s/5Ppxs0k72u).
