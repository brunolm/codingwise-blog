I wanted to create a project using TypeScript + Babel. I knew I would have to setup a few things.

I choose to use Webpack because it has some dev tools, auto-reload. And it is nice to use loaders. But I couldn't find any minimal simple examples, so I decided to create one.

[brunolm/typescript-babel-webpack](https://github.com/brunolm/typescript-babel-webpack) is a project with just the essential, nothing else. Simple and clean.

You can see that in this project there is a `README.md` where I tried to write all the steps I went through to create that setup and the issues I faced.

I recently started using Workflowy (it is free), which is a website where you can create lists and it allows you to use as a brain dump. If you want to check it out you can use this link to get extra items [https://workflowy.com/invite/35df8d82.lnx](https://workflowy.com/invite/35df8d82.lnx)

On [my Knowledge List](https://workflowy.com/s/5Ppxs0k72u) I added things about Babel and Webpack.
