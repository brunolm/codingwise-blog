TL;DR; Workflowy is a (free) website where you can take notes and doesn't matter how big it gets it is still easy to manage. Check it out [https://workflowy.com/invite/35df8d82.lnx](https://workflowy.com/invite/35df8d82.lnx)

Workflowy is a (free) website where you can take notes on lists. It is being really useful for me because I can take notes of steps I take to complete something then when I need it again I can just look at my notes instead of having to figure it all out again. I can also take notes of commands I run so if I need something crazy again I don't have to figure it out, it is already there.

If you want to try it out you can register with this link [https://workflowy.com/invite/35df8d82.lnx](https://workflowy.com/invite/35df8d82.lnx)

<!--more-->

It is a referral link, it means you will get +250 items/month for free (I will get it as well, you can refer your friends to get more items/month).

You can take notes about everything. It is like Trello, works not only for development but works for marketing, cooking, training...

Some things about it:

- You can check items as completed
- You can share a specific list (view only or view &amp; edit)
- You can create lists to any depth
- There are keyboard shortcuts
- It saves automatically

Examples:

- Step-by-step on how to create a Angular2 project [http://i.imgur.com/WXfXwOT.png](http://i.imgur.com/WXfXwOT.png)
- Knowledge list [http://i.imgur.com/XVqQr2Y.png](http://i.imgur.com/XVqQr2Y.png)

You could also build:

- List to save links (just like Pocket; [checkout this extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/workflowy-clipper/pmolhkonbppmihdpjmgclnclfppjndom))
- Crazy ideas list, take notes and never forget crazy ideas again (there is a mobile app)
- Shopping list
- TODO list when someone joins/leaves group/company/...
- Steps taken to complete a task (remember what was done, commands that you needed...)
- Cooking recipes

Just like Trello there are plenty ways to use it, you just have to figure them out.

So, wanna try it out? [https://workflowy.com/invite/35df8d82.lnx](https://workflowy.com/invite/35df8d82.lnx)
