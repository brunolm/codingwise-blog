[ASP.NET 5 is dead](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ASPNET5IsDeadIntroducingASPNETCore10AndNETCore10.aspx), now it is called ASP.NET Core 1.0.

  - ASP.NET 5 is now ASP.NET Core 1.0
  - .NET Core 5 is now .NET Core 1.0
  - Entity Framework 7 is now Entity Framework Core 1.0

It is not yet officially released, they dont have a date yet but they said they wont take just a month but they wont take years. You can use it today in production if you want to, but as it is not done yet some things could break, be renamed...
<!--more-->


The rename happened because .NET Core is something new, it is not as complete as the .NET 4.6, it is a new concept.

To learn more about ASP.NET decision subscribe to [Scott Hanselmen on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itxqo50klXM&amp;list=PL0M0zPgJ3HSftTAAHttA3JQU4vOjXFquF)to check out the ASP.NET Community Standup. Every standup gets a [blog post, you can follow it on MSDN blog with the tagcommunitystandup](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/webdev/tag/communitystandup/).

There is also a [really interesting series on Channel9 from ASP.NET Monsters](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/aspnetmonsters), they have a series of small videos explaining the bits of the new ASP.NET.

To play around with it you can install any updates that come in your notifications on Visual Studio then go to File &gt; New Project &gt; Web &gt; ASP.NET &gt; choose a template and you will get a initial setup where you can play. You can also check [this chaotic repository called Entropy](https://github.com/aspnet/Entropy) with experimental stuff.

And if you are curious about what Im doing you can [check my playground](https://github.com/brunolm/aspnet-core-playground), I just started it.
